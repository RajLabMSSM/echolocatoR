### The *echoverse* 

``r pkg`` is part of the [__*echoverse*__](https://github.com/topics/echoverse), a suite of R packages designed to facilitate different steps in genetic fine-mapping. 

``r pkg`` calls each of these other packages (i.e. "modules") internally to create a unified pipeline. However, you can also use each module independently to create your own custom workflows.

## Introduction

Fine-mapping methods are a powerful means of identifying causal variants
underlying a given phenotype, but are underutilized due to the technical
challenges of implementation. ***echolocatoR*** is an R package that
automates end-to-end genomics fine-mapping, annotation, and plotting in
order to identify the most probable causal variants associated with a
given phenotype.

It requires minimal input from users (a GWAS or QTL summary statistics
file), and includes a suite of statistical and functional fine-mapping
tools. It also includes extensive access to datasets (linkage
disequilibrium panels, epigenomic and genome-wide annotations, QTL).

The elimination of data gathering and preprocessing steps enables rapid
fine-mapping of many loci in any phenotype, complete with locus-specific
publication-ready figure generation. All results are merged into a
single per-SNP summary file for additional downstream analysis and
results sharing. Therefore ***echolocatoR*** drastically reduces the
barriers to identifying causal variants by making the entire
fine-mapping pipeline rapid, robust and scalable.

## `echofinemap`: Fine-mapping tools

***echolocatoR*** will automatically check whether you have the
necessary columns to run each tool you selected in
`echolocatoR::finemap_loci(finemap_methods=...)`.
It will remove any tools that for
which there are missing necessary columns, and produces a message
letting you know which columns are missing. Note that some columns (e.g.
`MAF`,`N`,`t-stat`) can be automatically inferred if missing.  
For easy reference, we list the necessary columns here as well.  
See `?finemap_loci()` for descriptions of these columns.  
All methods require the columns: `SNP`,`CHR`,`POS`,`Effect`,`StdErr`

Additional required columns:

```{r}
knitr::kable(echofinemap::required_cols())
```

## Multi-finemap results files

The main output of ***echolocatoR*** are the multi-finemap files (for
example, `echodata::BST1`). They are stored in the locus-specific
*Multi-finemap* subfolders.

### Column descriptions

-   **Standardized GWAS/QTL summary statistics**: e.g.
    `SNP`,`CHR`,`POS`,`Effect`,`StdErr`. See `?finemap_loci()` for
    descriptions of each.  
-   **leadSNP**: The designated proxy SNP per locus, which is the SNP
    with the smallest p-value by default.
-   **\<tool\>.CS**: The 95% probability Credible Set (CS) to which a
    SNP belongs within a given fine-mapping tool's results. If a SNP is
    not in any of the tool's CS, it is assigned `NA` (or `0` for the
    purposes of plotting).  
-   **\<tool\>.PP**: The posterior probability that a SNP is causal for
    a given GWAS/QTL trait.  
-   **Support**: The total number of fine-mapping tools that include the
    SNP in its CS.
-   **Consensus_SNP**: By default, defined as a SNP that is included in
    the CS of more than `N` fine-mapping tool(s), i.e. `Support>1`
    (default: `N=1`).  
-   **mean.PP**: The mean SNP-wise PP across all fine-mapping tools
    used.
-   **mean.CS**: If mean PP is greater than the 95% probability
    threshold (`mean.PP>0.95`) then `mean.CS` is 1, else 0. This tends
    to be a very stringent threshold as it requires a high degree of
    agreement between fine-mapping tools.

### Notes

-   Separate multi-finemap files are generated for each LD reference
    panel used, which is included in the file name (e.g.
    *UKB_LD.Multi-finemap.tsv.gz*).

-   Each fine-mapping tool defines its CS and PP slightly differently,
    so please refer to the associated original publications for the
    exact details of how these are calculated (links provided above).
